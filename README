# A (for now) nameless 3D reinterpretation of the classic game SimTower

## Description
This project is a 3D reinterpretation of the classic game SimTower. The game is a simulation game where the player is tasked with building and managing a skyscraper. The player must build floors, manage tenants, and keep the building running smoothly. The game will feature a 3D environment with a first-person perspective. The player will be able to move around the building, build floors, and interact with tenants. 
The game will also feature a day-night cycle and weather effects to add to the realism of the simulation.

## Development
The game is being developed using the Godot game engine by a team of a single developer with basically no gaming background as a pastime activity.
My professional background is in network and embedded systems programming, so this is more of a learning thing than doing something commercial.
